- comments:
As labelled, data is now using deconvolved calcium (inferred spikes), obtained by running OASIS (Friedrich et al., 2017)
 on the df/f data (thresholded variant with a first-order autoregressive model (AR(1)) 
 and an automatically-estimated transient decay time constant for each ROI.)

 From this week, also saving ROI indexes for neural data subsets.

 This is deconvolved, second_half_stim, and additionally had predict-on-train run. New f1-scoring

 This is as above but with ONLY tectal neurons (majority, a random 10000)
