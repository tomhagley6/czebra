- version 1 is from last week, and successive versions are from this week.
- 2 and 3 are identical input showing identical results.
- 4 is identical input, but without using the continuous variable in training.
- v5 is identical imput, but without using discrete variable in training (continuous only) (seems to fail to classify)

f1_221103_spot-label_second-half-stims_time-since-last_tectal_10000rois_2000iters_128hidden_0.001L2_0.8train:
- version 1 is with ALL data, did some analysis on smoothing/averaging predictions
- v2 is without any 0 data at the beginning. This version includes "long form" stimulus-triggered average, which lasts for 
- 300 seconds or 1500 points (a little longer than then average ISI)
- all of the above used a uniform kernel convolution for smoothing: size 50 for whole-data, size 10 for stim triggered avg.
    PARTIAL FIT BELOW 
- v3 had semantic errors - ignore this
- v4 and v5 are the correct versions for predict-on-train and predict-on-test partial fits respectively. Each were separated into steps 
  of 100 iterations, up to 2000 iterations. Separate models were run for predict-on-train and predict-on-test (same random
  seed). Models were not saved because of a bug in cebra.CEBRA.partial_fit().

f1_221103_spottime_tectal_10000rois_2000iters_128hidden_0.001L2_0.8train:
- CEBRA-Time model where I'm predicting time in experiment using either the training embedding or the test embedding
- This will need to be re-done because I'm extrapolating time in this version
