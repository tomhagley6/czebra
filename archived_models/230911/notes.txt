- comments:
As labelled, data is now using deconvolved calcium (inferred spikes), obtained by running OASIS (Friedrich et al., 2017)
 on the df/f data (thresholded variant with a first-order autoregressive model (AR(1)) 
 and an automatically-estimated transient decay time constant for each ROI.)

repeat of last week's trial time for a starting point

Same as the above, but with 30% of all ROIs. Any higher and VRAM is maxed

Now also including a continuous 'contrast' variable alongside the discrete variable which counts up 
throughout the stimulus.

Entirely replaced training label with a 'time-since-last' stimulus label.
This folder is all ROIs. The decoder only works on training data

As above. This folder is tectal only. The decoder still only works on training data

Folder to test reproducibility when all seeds are set to the same constant
The model itself is the same as an earlier folder. Discrete and continuous, all neurons (subset 10000), second half
of stims, deconvolved, trial time.
